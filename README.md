# Overview
This is a toy project where I'm developing a compiler, a custom ISA, and an emulator to run it all. I hope to one day get this to a point where the emulator, running a simple operating system, can bootstrap its own compiler.

This project is currently very much in flux. I'm currently getting into some of the more advanced features of the language, such as types, arrays, and structures. Pretty soon this should lead up to more work on the system as a whole, and starting to actually use the language for more than just tests.
